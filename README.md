# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to review the rides taken during the first quarter of 2019 based on city type (urban, rural, suburban). By displaying the results of this analysis in a line graph, we can easily identify trends, peaks, and dips in the total fares between Jan - Apr 2019.  (The graph displays weekly total fares.)

## Results: 
As is expected, there is a positive correlation between city size and total number of Rides, Drivers, and Fares. 
- Urban areas accounted for 1625 total rides, 2405 total drivers, and $39,854.38 total fares
- Suburban areas accounted for 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, and $19,356.33 total fares
- Rural areas accounted for 125 total rides, 78 total drivers, and $4,327.93 total fares

There is a negative correlation between city size and Average fare per ride and driver. This can likely be attributed to the proximity of amenities within urban areas.  In urban areas, rides are often shorter, as amenities are closer. 
- Urban areas had an average fare per ride of $24.53 and an average fare per driver of $16.57
- Suburban areas had an average fare per ride of $30.97 and an average fare per driver of $39.50
- Rural areas had an average fare per ride of $34.62 and an average fare per driver of $55.49

All three city types saw an over all increase in total fares from the begining of the quarter to the end of the quarter:
- Urban areas increased from $1,661.68 in week 1 to $2,238.29 in week 17
- Suburban areas increased from $721.60 in week 1 to $1,357.75 in week 17
- Rural areas increased from $187.92 in week 1 to $191.85 in week 17

## Summary: 
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:
1) As urban areas generate the most revenue, continue current business plan for urban areas.
2) Depending on demand, an increase in drivers may be required in rural areas, as they make the most per driver.
3) Suburban areas had the highest increase from week 1 to week 17, so an increase in marketing in these areas may result in higher revenues.
